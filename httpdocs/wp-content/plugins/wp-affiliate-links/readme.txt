WP Affiliate Links cloaks, tracks, redirects your links, split test offers by country, hide your referrers from merchants and affiliate networks!

== Description ==

= Shorten your links. Turn long URLs into your-domain.com/short-url. Great for affiliate marketers who want to cloak their links, or anyone else who wants to have pretty URLs and track their outbound traffic. =

Here's how it works:

1) Click on 'Create Link' in the WP Affiliate Links section of WordPress admin panel.

2) Enter a name for the link (for management purposes) and a 'slug' name for the URL (for example, www.your-domain.com/slug-name).

3) Enter the destination URL for the cloaked link, i.e. www.some-external-url.com/some-page

4) Click 'Save Link.'

**After that, you can use the WP Affiliate Links-powered cloaked link everywhere you would have used the original URL.**

WP Affiliate Links will track clicks on your links, providing a detailed summary and information on individual clicks like browser type, IP address, country code, and referring URL.

Generate click reports for any time period, and export all click data to CSV for further analysis. 

Automatically turn keywords on your site into links. Specify the keyword and it will be replaced in your Pages/Posts with a link.

Send visitors in different countries to different destinations. Useful for affiliate marketers who want to promote country-specific offers. your-domain.com/4-hour-work-week can send German visitors to Amazon.de and US visitors to Amazon.com.

Automatically match existing URLs on your site in your existing Pages/Posts. If you have links to whatever.com you can turn them all into links to your-domain.com/whatever.

Support for sub IDs. 

Support for a prefix so you can have your-domain.com/prefix/your-link instead of your-domain.com/your-link
